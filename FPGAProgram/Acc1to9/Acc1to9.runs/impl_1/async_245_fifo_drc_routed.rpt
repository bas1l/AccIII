IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO io_data[0] connects to flops which have these SYS_RST/i_reg[7], SYS_RST/usb_en_reg set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO io_data[1] connects to flops which have these SYS_RST/i_reg[7], SYS_RST/usb_en_reg set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO io_data[2] connects to flops which have these SYS_RST/i_reg[7], SYS_RST/usb_en_reg set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO io_data[3] connects to flops which have these SYS_RST/i_reg[7], SYS_RST/usb_en_reg set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
